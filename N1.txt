1️⃣ What is Emmet?

Emmet is a tool in code editors that helps you write HTML & CSS faster using shortcuts.

Example:

Instead of writing:

<div>
  <p></p>
</div>


You type:

div>p


👉 Press Tab → Code appears automatically.

🔹 Why use Emmet?

Saves time

Reduces typing

Increases speed & productivity

2️⃣ Difference between Library and Framework
Library	Framework
You control the flow	Framework controls the flow
You call the library	Framework calls your code
Example: React	Example: Angular

👉 Simple line:

A library is like a helper you call when needed.
A framework is like a boss that tells your code when to run.

3️⃣ What is CDN? Why do we use it?

CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a network of servers placed around the world that deliver files (JS, CSS, images) from the nearest location to the user.

Why we use CDN:

Faster website loading 🚀

Less load on main server

Better performance & reliability

Example:
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>


React is loaded from a CDN, not your server.

4️⃣ Why is React known as React?

React is called React because it reacts to changes in data.

👉 When data changes:

React updates only the required part of UI

Not the whole page

This makes apps fast and efficient.

5️⃣ What is crossorigin in <script> tag?

crossorigin allows a browser to load files from another domain safely.

Example:
<script src="https://example.com/script.js" crossorigin></script>

Why it is used:

Prevents security issues

Helps with proper error handling

Required when using CDNs

6️⃣ Difference between React and ReactDOM
React	ReactDOM
Builds UI components	Renders UI to the browser
Logic & components	Works with DOM
Platform independent	Browser specific

👉 Simple line:

React creates components.
ReactDOM puts them on the webpage.

7️⃣ Difference between
react.development.js and react.production.js
Development	Production
Large file	Small & optimized
Shows warnings & errors	No warnings
Slower	Faster
Used while coding	Used after deployment

👉 Simple line:

Use development for learning & debugging.
Use production for live websites.

8️⃣ What is async and defer?

Both are used to load JS files without blocking HTML loading.

Normal script:

HTML stops until JS loads

async

Loads JS and runs it immediately

Order not guaranteed

<script src="file.js" async></script>

defer

Loads JS in background

Runs after HTML is fully loaded

Order is maintained

<script src="file.js" defer></script>


👉 Simple rule to remember:

async → fast but unpredictable

defer → safe and ordered (best for most cases)

📌 One-line Revision (Cheat Sheet)

Emmet → Fast coding shortcuts

Library vs Framework → You control vs Framework controls

CDN → Faster content delivery

React → Reacts to data changes

crossorigin → Secure cross-domain loading

React vs ReactDOM → Create vs Render

Dev vs Prod React → Debug vs Fast

async vs defer → Unordered vs Ordered loading
